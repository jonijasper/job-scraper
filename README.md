Simple scraper for searching and filtering jobs. 

Main goals:

  1. implement more opt-out style of filtering, so the search results show a broader range of potential jobs while removing only spesific unwanted results
  2. reduce time wasted on "clickbaity" titles, by checking the job describtion during the scraping process by matching a configurable blacklist of buzzwords, and tagging potential clickbaits
